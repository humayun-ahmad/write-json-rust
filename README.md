# Rust JSON Writer

This project demonstrates how to serialize Rust structures into JSON format and write them to a file using Rust. It's a basic example that covers the use of external crates, serialization, file I/O, and basic error handling in Rust. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the fundamentals of Rust programming, especially in handling JSON data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you haven't installed Rust, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-json-writer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rust-json-writer
   ```
3. Build the project using Cargo (this will automatically download and compile the necessary dependencies):
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command from the root of the project directory:
```bash
cargo run
```
This command serializes a predefined Rust structure into JSON format and writes it to a file named `user.json` in the project directory. You can modify the `src/main.rs` file to serialize different data or to change the output file's name and location.

### Example Structure

Here is the Rust structure used for serialization in this project:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    email: String,
}
```

You can customize this structure in the `src/main.rs` file to fit your data serialization needs.
